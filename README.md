# Huffman-coding-algorithm
Information Theory Exercise at DUT University

How to use all of these file:

    Step 1 (Provide the original): Load the original text you want to encode into the  original_text.txt

    Step 2 (Encoding): Run the Huffman-algorithm_encoding.cpp. The encoded text will be in encoded_text.txt.

    Step 3 (Decoding): Run the Huffman-algorithm_decoding.cpp. The decoded text will be in decoded_text.txt.

    The decoded text should be the same with the original text.
    That's it !!!!!!!!
